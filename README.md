# Pacifist's Preference â€” PvP-toggle for distinguished gentlemen

A basic, currently in-dev plugin for allowing players to toggle player-versus-player (*PvP*) on and off on demand.

Simply run `/pvp` to toggle your PvP state to *on* or *off* or explicitly select a state by using `/pvp on` or `/pvp off`.

This plugin currently handles the following PvP events:
* Damaging players directly
* Damaging players through projectiles
* Having your pets damage PvP-disabled players 
* Throwing harmful splash potions at PvP-disabled players
* Throwing harmful lingering potions at PvP-disabled players
* Placing lava, tnt, tnt minecarts and end crystals near PvP-disabled players
* Doing any of the above to PvP-disabled player's pets
